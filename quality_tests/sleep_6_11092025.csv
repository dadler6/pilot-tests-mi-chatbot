0,user,Got it. Ready whenever you are.
1,assistant,"Thank you for letting me join you today. To start, how have you been feeling recently?"
2,user,"Honestly, pretty overwhelmed. Work has been really stressful, and I’ve been worrying nonstop about the possibility of getting fired. It’s been keeping me up at night, and I just feel drained."
3,assistant,"It sounds like there's been a lot on your plate lately, with work stress and the fear of losing your job weighing heavily on you. Staying up at night probably adds to that exhaustion you're feeling. How have you been coping with all of this?"
4,user,"I don’t really know if I am coping, to be honest. I just kind of lie awake and go over every possible scenario in my head until I eventually fall asleep, and then I’m exhausted the next day. I don’t feel like I’m handling it well at all."
5,assistant,"It sounds like you're caught in a cycle that's taking a toll, both emotionally and physically. Staying up feeling anxious and replaying scenarios seems like it’s been really hard on you. What would it look like if things felt a little easier for you right now?"
6,user,"I guess if I wasn’t so worried about work all the time and could trust that my job was secure, I might actually be able to relax. If I could just sleep through the night and not wake up already feeling stressed, that would make a huge difference."
7,assistant,"It seems like being able to trust in your job security and getting restful sleep would bring some much-needed relief. That sounds really important to you. What kinds of things help you relax, even if only a little, when you're feeling this way?"
8,user,"Honestly, I haven’t found much that helps me relax lately. Sometimes I’ll try watching TV or scrolling through my phone, but that just feels like a distraction, not real relaxation. I’m not even sure I remember what genuine relaxation feels like."
9,assistant,"It sounds like finding real relaxation feels out of reach right now, and the things you’ve been trying don’t seem to provide the kind of relief you’re looking for. That must be really frustrating. Have you noticed anything—even something small—that helps lighten the weight just a little?"
